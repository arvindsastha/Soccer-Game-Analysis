# Soccer-Game-Analysis

## Introduction ##
The idea is to visualize and analyze a soccer game using Socnet Visualization tool.

## Socnet Visualization Tool ##
Social Network Visualizer (SocNetV) is a cross-platform, user-friendly free software application for social network analysis and visualization. 
With SocNetV we can draw social networks with a few clicks on a virtual canvas, load field data from a file in a supported format (GraphML, GraphViz, Adjacency, EdgeList, GML, Pajek, UCINET, etc) or crawl the internet to create a social network of connected webpages.
Edit actors and ties through point-and-click, analyse graph and social network properties, produce beautiful HTML reports and embed visualization layouts to the network.

#### Main features: ####

1. Standard graph and network cohesion metrics, such as density, diameter, geodesics and distances, connectedness, eccentricity, clustering coefficient, reciprocity, etc.</br>
2. Matrix routines: Adjacency plot, Laplacian matrix, Degree matrix, Cocitation, etc</br>
3. Advanced measures for social network analysis such as centrality and prestige indices (i.e. eigenvector and closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, information centrality, power centrality, proximity and pagerank prestige).</br>
4. Fast algorithms for community detection, such as triad census, clique census,etc.</br>
5. Structural equivalence analysis, using hierarchical clustering, actor similarities and tie profile dissimilarities, Pearson coefficients.</br>
6. Layout models based either on prominence indices (i.e. circular, level and nodal sizes by centrality score) or on force-directed placement (i.e. Kamada-Kawai, Fruchterman-Reingold, etc) for meaningful visualizations of the social networks.</br>
7. Multirelational network loading and editing. Load a social network consisting of multiple relations or create a social network on your own and add multiple relations to it.</br>
8. Random network creation using various random network generation models (Barabási–Albert Scale-Free, Erdős–Rényi, Watts-Strogatz Small-World, d-regular, ring lattice, etc)</br>
9. Famous social network analysis datasets, i.e. Padgett's Florentine families.</br>
10. Built-in web crawler  to automatically create "social networks" from links found in a given initial URL.</br>
11. Comprehensive documentation, both online and inside the application, which explains each feature and algorithm of SocNetV in detail.</br>
